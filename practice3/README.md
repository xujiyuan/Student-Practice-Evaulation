# working with integration test & unit test and js/ts

## This is relatively more challenging than the previous practices but again, very valuable. This mini express app uses mocha as testing framework and chai for assertion library. You can find more information about these two dependencies online

## Instruction:

- Step 1. look the test file under test directory
- Step 2. look at the ts files under src directory
- Step 3. implement the tests
- Step 4. implement the missing function

### Run the test using command

`npm run test-dev`

### Make sure all tests pass with valuable mock data, you do not need to use mock stub spy, we will visit them later

### Add more tests if you think necessary

### Finally help me optimize the practice for future students
