# Student practice questions: playing with list in javascript

## This practice is very simple but very useful, it's a good way for you to get familar with JS native functions.

## find the list of test data in index.js

## Given a list of employees, I want a subset of data with requirements below:

- Only OIT employees
- a new field called fullname that concat firstname and lastname with a space in between
- I do not want to get duplicate last name, only pick one when there are people with same last name
- I want the id sorted asc

## Please try to use javascript native functions such as filter, find, map, reduce etc to accomplish this task.
